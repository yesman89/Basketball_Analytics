    "Look into Pete Maravich Stats\n",
    "If you look at 1980, there are three entries for Pete Maravich because he transferred midseason from Utah to Boston (or vice versa), so he has a row for his stats from playing for Utah, Boston, and then TOT (total statistics from the 1980 season). For it to be the same as basketballreference.com, I think you need to use either the total from that season or just the individual numbers for his time with Utah or Boston."
